# Weight-Initialization-Techniques-in-PyTorch-with-MNIST

This repository provides an in-depth look at weight initialization methods for neural networks using PyTorch. The notebook, **Weight Initialization in PyTorch**, explores various initialization strategies and applies them to the MNIST dataset, illustrating their impact on model performance and convergence.

## Contents

- **Weight Initialization Methods**: A variety of techniques, such as Xavier, He, and Uniform initializations.
- **MNIST Dataset**: Leverages the MNIST dataset to demonstrate how different initializations affect training on a simple neural network.
- **PyTorch Implementation**: Uses PyTorch's `torch` and `torchvision` libraries for dataset handling and model building.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- Torchvision
